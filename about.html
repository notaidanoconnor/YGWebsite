    <p>	
        Aidan O’Connor birthed Yung Grandma from a dark womb of obscurity, creating a persona and style of music that crosses every kind of boundary imaginable. Often with obscene, disgusting, and offensive subject matter, Yung Grandma explores a multitude of genres and styles whilst transcending the shock-value that tends to draw in his listeners. Diving in and out of Alternative Rock, Indie, Rap, Dream-Pop, Hyper-pop, Experimental, Classical, and Electronic music, Yung Grandma incorporates his voice and production style into everything he does.

        As a producer and composer, Yung Grandma aims to form a sonic environment out of his unique conjunction of electronic and classical music. His imaginative use of sound design combined with his ever-traveling melodies lead you through a captivating space once described by Grammy award-winning composer, Mason Bates, as a “Wonderful quirky soundworld”. 
        Yung Grandma released his first album along with nine others in October of 2022, quickly gaining recognition for his selected albums of contemporary classical and electronic music.
